    "This notebook is dedicated to **transfer learning**. \n",

    "We have seen that the convolutions are mathematical operation that detect specific patterns in input images and use them to classify the image. One could imagine that these patterns are not 100% specific to the task but to the input images. Therefore, why not using convolutions that have been learnt on other task with the expectation that it will also work in other scenario. This has two advantages: taking less time to train and benefiting from complex architecture that have been trained for state-of-the-art challenges. We here _transfer_ a CNN from one task to another => _transfer learning_. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ The convolutions may not be specific! However, the last layer is by design specific to the problem it was trained on! Therefore, this last layer is usually removed, replace by a layer that is design to the task. As this new last layer has random weight, it has to be retrained. This is called _fine-tunning_. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use the [VGG-16 Neural Network](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/), a well-known architecture that has been trained on ImageNet which is a very large database of images of different categories. In a nutshell, this architecture has already learnt kernels which are supposed to be good not only for the task it has been train on but maybe for other tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that first layers are not specialized for the particular task it has been trained on ; only the last ones are. Therefore, we will load the existing VGG16 network, remove the last fully connected layers, replace them by new connected layers (whose weights are randomly set), and train these last layers on a specific classification task - here, separate types of flower. The underlying idea is that the first convolutional layers of VGG-16, that has already been trained, corresponds to filters that are able to extract meaning features from images. And you will only learn the last layers for your particular problem.\n",
